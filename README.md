- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jahnvi13
- 👀  I’m a CSAI undergrad with a knack for problem solving. 
- My vision is to make my GitHub repo a one-stop solution for all kinds of algorithmic problems with a focus on problem solving and not the algorithms itself.     
- 🌱 Currently, I am indulged in competitive programming and research in the field of NLP and data science.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that aim at building solutions for real-life problems.  
- 📫 If you have any query, feel free to make a PR or raise an issue.
If you find my work helpful, contact me via mail at jahnvi19469@iiitd.ac.in.
